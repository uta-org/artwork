**"GetAssetPreview in UnityEngine" will provide you a method to create previews for your GameObjects in-game.** 

**GetAssetPreview** is optimized for most platforms. 

**Clean, simple and easy to understand**, this asset contains a [README file](https://dev.z3nth10n.net/dev/assets/getassetpreview/manuals/) and a (documentation API)[https://dev.z3nth10n.net/dev/assets/getassetpreview/docs/] where you can find the most important aspects of this asset.

**Main contents:** 

⮚ Several models used as an exaple.
⮚ Custom inspector and tooltips.
⮚ A Rainbow shader for testing.
⮚ Several utilities like the marquee text (that you can use on other projects), a rotation system (that can be previewed).
⮚ A progress bar (useful to understand how async loading works).

**Main features:** 

⮚ Supports any prefab.
⮚ Supports transparent textures.
⮚ Supports multiple objects batching (preview as much assets as you need at once!)
⮚ Supports modding (you can override the default **"AssetPreviewer class"** to get custom effects).
